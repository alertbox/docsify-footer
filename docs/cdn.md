# CDN

> We use [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@alertbox/docsify-footer), which will reflect the latest version as soon as it is published to npmjs.com.

At any point that you want to add the plugin:

- Avoid using the dev-version for production sites; consider using the minified versions instead
- Avoid using the latest version for production sites; always specify which version you want to refer
- Avoid adding the plugin as a dependency via `npm install` or `yarn add`; always use the CDN hosted
