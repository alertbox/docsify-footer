# Footer Content

> Just write it in Markdown as you do everywhere else.

For example, here's our `_footer.md` markdown file. We only had to do this:

[filename](_footer.md ':include :type=code')

Docsify uses markdown as it's default parser. This plugin supports docsify's extended markdown syntax that makes the document more readable. Check out some of the Doc Helpers:

- [Important Content](https://docsify.js.org/#/helpers?id=important-content)
- [General Tips](https://docsify.js.org/#/helpers?id=general-tips)

!> Markdown in html is not yet supported. We'd be glad if you could send us a pull request for that.
